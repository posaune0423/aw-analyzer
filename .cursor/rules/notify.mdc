At the end of any task run the command `osascript -e 'display notification "通知の内容" with title "タイトル" subtitle "サブタイトル"'`

Include workspace context in the notification:

- Title: `{title} — {repo}:{branch}`
- Message: `{message}\nPath: {workspacePath}`

Where:

- `{repo}` is the git repository name (fallback: basename of `{workspacePath}`)
- `{branch}` is the current git branch (fallback: `no-vcs`)
- `{workspacePath}` is the absolute path to the workspace

If a PR is created as part of the task, append `PR: {prUrl}` to the message when available.
